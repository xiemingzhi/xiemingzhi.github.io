Hi All <br />I am looking for a java package that will help me in checking a stream of  data.<br />This will be used on the network and will probably do the checking on the  fly.<br />So the sender will probably send a checksum followed by a delimiter followed  by the stream of bytes.<br />The receiver will store the checksum read the bytes, compute the checksum and  compare it with the sent checksum.<br />Is this how byte streaming checksums are supposed to be done?<br />Any feedback would be appreciated.
