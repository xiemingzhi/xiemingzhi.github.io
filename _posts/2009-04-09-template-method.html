<p>use template method when you need a base class to contain a certain behaviour  with some base algorithms while having the subclasses implement those other  behaviours that can vary.</p> <p>ie. an abstract class with final methods (methods that cannot be overridden  in the subclasses)and abstract methods (these methods have to be implemented in  the subclasses).</p> <p>This is a good method for controlling at which point your classes can be  subclassed.</p>
