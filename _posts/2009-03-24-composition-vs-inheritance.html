<div dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">favour composition over inheritance.</div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">even though you have common code in the  base class and child classes uses those methods it is better to move those  common methods to another class and then the child classes have instances of  those classes with those methods for accessing.</div><div dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px;">lots of common code in base classes leads  to child classes changing inheritances and can lead to unstable code.</div>
