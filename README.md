Uninstalling Chocolatey
Should you decide you don't like Chocolatey, you can uninstall it simply by removing the folder (and the environment variable(s) that it creates). Since it is not actually installed in Programs and Features, you don't have to worry that it cluttered up your registry (however that's a different story for the applications that you installed with Chocolatey or manually).

Folder
Most of Chocolatey is contained in C:\ProgramData\chocolatey or whatever $env:ChocolateyInstall evaluates to. You can simply delete that folder.

NOTE You might first back up the sub-folders lib and bin just in case you find undesirable results in removing Chocolatey. Bear in mind not every Chocolatey package is an installer package, there may be some non-installed applications contained in these subfolders that could potentially go missing. Having a backup will allow you to test that aspect out.

Github.io blogging supports rouge (_config.xml).  
Github repository supports Pygments (README.md).

```java

	public static void main(String args[]) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}

Conversion error: Jekyll::Converters::Scss encountered an error while converting 'assets/css/main.scss':
                    Invalid CP950 character "\xE2" on line 54
jekyll 3.8.5 | Error:  Invalid CP950 character "\xE2" on line 54
```
## solution 
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/#encoding  
EncodingPermalink  
If you use UTF-8 encoding, make sure that no BOM header characters exist in your files or very, very bad things will happen to Jekyll. This is especially relevant when youâ€™re running Jekyll on Windows.  
Additionally, you might need to change the code page of the console window to UTF-8 in case you get a Liquid Exception: Incompatible character encoding error during the site generation process. It can be done with the following command:
```
chcp 65001
```
